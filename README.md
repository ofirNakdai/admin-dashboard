## 💻 Installation

To install and set up the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, you can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

   Then, install the required packages using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file and create a node_modules folder.

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
 Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
 You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
 See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
 It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
 Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them.  
 All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## 🚀 Running the Application

To run the application locally:

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start

   ```

2. **Open your browser:**

   Navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see your React app running.

## 🛠️ Building the Application

To build the application for production:

1. **Run the build command:**

   ```bash
   npm run build

   ```

2. **Deploy the build:**

   The `build` folder will contain your optimized app, which you can then deploy to your preferred hosting service.
